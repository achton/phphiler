Decompressing and file locations
================================
  The distribution file is named after the following convention:
    phphiler-x.x.x[-rcx].tar.[gz|bz2]

  By default, the archive decompresses into a new directory called
  'phphiler-x.x.x[-rcx]'. The name and location of this directory is not
  important, however, as long as the webserver has read (and possibly
  write) access to it.

  PHPhiler expects to find the configuration file in the root directory of
  your webserver, (often '/www/'), so this file has to be moved there after
  the decompression. It must also be renamed from phphiler.config.sample.inc
  to phphiler.config.inc.

  The remaining .inc-files have to be placed in one single directory. It is
  strongly recommended to dedicate a directory entirely to PHPhiler's source
  files, but not required (in theory, anyway).


Incorporating PHPhiler into your site
=====================================

  You should begin by setting the path variable for PHPhiler in the
  configuration file, e.g.:

    $this->setPHPhilerPath('phphiler/');

  Then include PHPhiler's cascading style sheet in the HTML code for the
  page that will render the file listing. This is also where you'll insert
  the necessary PHP code that activates PHPhiler.

    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
          href="http://myserver.com/phphiler/phphiler.sample.css">

  You could also move the contents of the CSS file to your own CSS file if
  you have one.

  Next make sure the main PHPhiler script is included:

  <?php
        require_once('/www/phphiler/phphiler.inc');
  ?>

  This requires the script to reside in the directory /www/phphiler/.

  Now create a new PHPhiler object somewhere in your PHP script:

  <?php
        $myPHPhiler = new PHPhiler();
  ?>

  The name of the variable that holds the PHPhiler object is not important,
  as long as you use it throughout for that particular table.

  Finally, call PHPhiler's indexing function where you want the table to
  appear on your webpage:

  <?php
        $myPHPhiler->index();
  ?>

  PHPhiler will now create a file listing of the current directory, using
  the default options from the configuration file.

  For more information on configuration options, please look at the file
  CONFIG.


File permissions
================

  PHPhiler contains certain (optional) features that require the webserver
  to have write access to the filesystem; specifically to the directory
  containing the indexed files.

  When utilizing the feature that encapsulates listed files in a custom
  header and footer (setSuffixActions is one of the settings that affects
  this feature), it is done through a template file that is written to the
  current directory on-the-fly. Therefore, the webserver needs to have write
  access to the directory in question. If you do not wish to allow this (or
  cannot due to some restriction or other), this feature will not be
  available.

  Thus far, all other features do not require write access. Due to the fact
  that some system administrators see this issue as a security risk, the
  development of PHPhiler will be striving towards minimizing writes to the
  filesystem.
