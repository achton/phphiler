Summary
=======

    PHPhiler is a free, Open Source file- and directory indexing mechanism,
    programmed in - you guessed it - PHP. It allows the administrator of any
    PHP-enabled website to create automatic tables and lists over files and
    directories, complete with descriptions, information retrieval actions and
    CSS-based layout for easy customization.

    Some installation and configuration instructions are included in the
    distribution archive, but for the most current and comprehensive
    instructions, please see the relevant sections on this website.

    PHPhiler is designed to be highly configurable and easy to utilize, as long
    as one has som very basic knowledge of PHP and website administration.

    * auto-generate file and directory indexes in HTML tables
    * supply direct HTTP-links to all elements
    * show file- and directory sizes
    * show modification date
    * descript files and directories from external sources such as:
          o XML-like text-files
          o filetype-specific information retrieval plugins (e.g. Windows URL files)
          o any PHP-based plugin you can think up that can get information from a file type (see actions)!
    * no database involved - it's all real-time!
    * customizable interface through CSS
    * customizable HTML table layout
    * clean, HTML4-compliant output for the user to enjoy! :-)

    That is the basic idea.
