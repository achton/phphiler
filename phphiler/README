Summary
=======

  PHPhiler is a free, open-source program intended to be incorporated into an
  existing PHP-based website.

  It allows a person with administrator access to that website to auto- generate
  directory and file listings of any directory that is accessible by the
  webserver. It supplies direct HTTP-links to the files and directories, along
  with other information such as size, modification date and the possibilty to
  have the files auto-descripted by various means. Effectively, this enables
  users to browse through the filesystem of a webserver.

  The interface is customizable through CSS and all initial configuration is
  done through a simple syntax in a seperate configuration file. It is possible
  to retrieve the titles and descriptions of files in a variety of ways,
  including the option of extracting these automatically from external files,
  provided the information is contained in a predefined syntax.

  PHPhiler is designed to be highly configurable, expandable and easy to
  implement into existing PHP-based websites. It should be fairly simple to
  extend the description retrieval mechanism with other filetypes (e.g.
  MP3-files, word processor documents, etc.), provided information can be
  retrieved from these filetypes through PHP. 
  
  And that's it. There is no database involved, no fancy backend, and no
  additional coding required.

Requirements
============
  PLEASE NOTE: These requirements are minimal. Since the program is still in
  its early development stages, it has not been thoroughly tested with all
  common combinations of hard- and software. If you come across errors in
  this regard, don't hesitate to submit a bug report.

  o Unix-like operating system (developed under Debian Linux 2.2.20)
  o webserver with PHP enabled (developed under Apache 2.0.43+ and PHP 4.3.0+)
  o administrative access to a website
  o very basic PHP/CSS/HTML skills

  It has been tested and is known to work under Novell Netware 6 and Apache.


Known problems
==============
  This version of PHPhiler has only been tested in a Unix-like environment.
  Thus, some aspects of the file manipulation mechanism may differ (and thus
  not work properly) on other systems, e.g. Windows.
