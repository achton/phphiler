Directory stuff:

    Document root (abs):
        is either
            - Set in config: setDocRoot
            - Not set: Apache $DOCUMENT_ROOT
        - get with getDocRoot()


    Startdir (abs/rel):
        is either
            - Constructor: PHPhiler (abs)
            - Constructor: PHPhiler (rel)
            - Not set: current directory (abs)
        - get with $startdir


    CWD (abs)
        - get with $this->cwd

PHPHILER ALGORITHM
==================

    * new phphiler object
        > get config
        > get debugger
        > check for doc root
        > check for phphiler source files
        > check for actions
        > if startdir was given, check if it was relative or absolute
            > if relative
                - convert to absolute with getcwd()
            - set cwd to startdir
            - set cwrd to NULL
        > if startdir was NOT given
            - set cwd to getcwd()


    * index is called
        - save original cwd
        - call update with cwd and max descend levels
